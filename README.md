# Introduction
This project explores top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and where high demand meets high salary in data analytics.

All SQL queries can be found here: [project_sql folder](/project_sql/)

# Background
Driven by the desire to apply my SQL skills to real problems, this project was born to identify the top-paid and in-demand skills for the Business Analyst positions.

Data hails from [Luke Barousse's Course](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql). It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
What are the top-paying business analyst jobs?
What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
What skills are most in demand for business analysts?
Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I used

- **SQL**: The main tool for my analysis, allowing me to query the database and discover critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the business analyst job market. Here’s how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Business Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered business analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name as company_name
FROM 
job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Business Analyst' AND 
    job_location= 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Some insights:

***1.	Top Salaries in Remote Work:***
The top full-remote job is “Lead Business Intelligence Engineer” at $220,000/year (Noom), with “Manager II, Applied Science - Marketplace Dynamics” (Uber, $214,500) following closely.

***2.	Prevalence of Leadership and Senior Roles:***
Many of the top roles, such as “Staff Revenue Operations Analyst” (Gladly, $170,500) and “REMOTE - Business Intelligence Analyst (Leadership Role)” (CyberCoders, $162,500), focus on leadership or specialized expertise.

***3.	Strong Demand for Flexibility and High Compensation:***
Filtering for remote jobs showcases competitive salaries, reflecting the increasing willingness of companies to pay premium rates for talent in flexible, full-remote setups.

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    salary_year_avg,
    name as company_name
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Business Analyst' AND 
    job_location= 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM 
    top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON skills_job_dim.job_id = top_paying_jobs.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```

Here are the insights from the “skills” column:
- 	SQL and Python are the most in-demand, appearing 5 times each.
- Excel and Tableau are also highly sought, with 4 mentions each.

### 3. In-Demand Skills for Business Analysts
This query helped identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.

```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON skills_job_dim.job_id = job_postings_fact.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Business Analyst'
    AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY 
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for data analysts in 2023:

- SQL and Excel remain fundamental, emphasizing the need for strong foundational skills in data processing and spreadsheet manipulation.
- Programming and Visualization Tools like Python, Tableau, and Power BI are essential, pointing towards the increasing importance of technical skills in data storytelling and decision support.

### 4. Skills Based on Salary
Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.

```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON skills_job_dim.job_id = job_postings_fact.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_dim.skill_id = skills_job_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Business Analyst' AND
    job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
    job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY 
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;
```
